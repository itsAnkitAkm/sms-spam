# SMS Spam Detection

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam (ham). We'll use natural language processing (NLP) techniques and various classifiers to achieve this goal.

## Table of Contents

1. **Project Overview**
    - Spam detection is essential for filtering unwanted messages and improving user experience. In this project, we'll explore different approaches to identify spam SMS messages accurately.

2. **Dataset**
    - We'll use a labeled dataset containing SMS messages, where each message is labeled as spam or ham. You can find such datasets on platforms like Kaggle or create your own by collecting labeled SMS messages.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
    - **Load the Dataset**: Read the dataset (usually in CSV format) into a Pandas DataFrame.
    - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, class distribution, and any missing values.
    - **Clean the Text**:
        - Remove special characters, punctuation, and numbers.
        - Convert text to lowercase.
        - Tokenize the text (split into individual words).
        - Remove stop words (common words like "the," "and," etc.).
        - Apply stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their root form.

4. **Feature Extraction**
    - **Bag-of-Words (BoW)**: Create a document-term matrix using CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer.
    - **Word Embeddings**: Consider using pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) to represent words as dense vectors.
    - **Other Features**: You can also extract features like message length, presence of specific keywords, etc.

5. **Model Building**
    - **Split the Data**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
    - **Choose a Classifier**:
        - Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB, BernoulliNB, GaussianNB)
        - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
        - Random Forest
        - Neural Networks (LSTM, in your case)
    - **Train the Model**: Fit the chosen classifier on the training data.
    - **Evaluate the Model**: Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and plot a confusion matrix.

6. **Evaluation**
    - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics. Tune hyperparameters if necessary.

7. **Usage**
    - Provide instructions on how to use your trained model for SMS spam detection. Include code snippets or examples.

8. **Contributing**
    - If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to submit pull requests or open issues.

9. **License**
    - Specify the license under which your project is released.
